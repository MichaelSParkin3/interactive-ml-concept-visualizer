A Jupyter Notebook to interactively visualize the concepts of linear regression using the California Housing dataset.

## （づ￣3￣）づ╭❤️～ Personal Note

I was learning about gradient descent, linear regression, and how AIs are trained. This project was perfect to solidify and visualize my learning. The google crash course on linear regression was a great help and i'd reccommend it to anyone learning.

## 📜 Description

This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding linear regression. It includes:
- A 2D visualization of linear regression with an animated fit line that updates in real-time during training.
- A 3D visualization of linear regression with two features, showing the regression plane.
- Clear, commented code to walk you through the process of data loading, model training, and visualization.

## ✨ Features

- **2D Animated Visualization**: Watch the regression line fit the data over epochs.
- **3D Plane Visualization**: See how linear regression extends to multiple features by plotting a regression plane.
- **Step-by-Step Code**: The notebook is organized into clear sections, from data preparation to model training and visualization.
- **Loss Visualization**: A plot to show how the Mean Squared Error (MSE) decreases over epochs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MichaelSParkin3/interactive-ml-concept-visualizer.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd interactive-ml-concept-visualizer
    ```
3.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook ml_visualizer.ipynb
    ```
